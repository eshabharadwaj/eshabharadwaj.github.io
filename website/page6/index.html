    <h2>How to sleep better</h2>
    <ul>
  <li>Wake up at the same time every day.</li>
  <li>Avoid stimulants past mid-day</li>
  <li>Get at least 20 to 30 minutes of exercise during the day.</li>
  <li>Avoid screens an hour before bedtime.</li>
  <li>Go to sleep at the same time every night.</li>
  <li>Avoid sleeping in—even on weekends.</li>
  <li>Be smart about napping</li>
  <li>Avoid big meals at night</li>
  <li>Avoid alcohol before bed</li>
</ul>
    <p>You can make 8 hours of quality sleep a regular part of your life by scheduling it. Make sleep part of your to-do list and plan your bedtime like you would any other appointment. You wouldn’t miss a meeting to binge watch TV, would you? Be strict about your sleep appointment in the same way. Keep a consistent schedule for sleep and wake times and soon they will become just a part of your regular routine. Support your schedule by creating a bedtime routine that relaxes you with hot baths, good books or soothing music.
